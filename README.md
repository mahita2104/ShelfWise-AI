## 💡 Project Overview

ShelfWise-AI tackles critical challenges in quality assurance for e-commerce and retail logistics. Here’s how it works:

1. **📦 Packaging Label Extraction**  
   Extracts essential information (like brand name and net weight) from product packaging to ensure accuracy and compliance.

2. **📅 Expiry Date Validation**  
   Identifies and standardizes expiry dates, manufacturing dates, and MRP on packaging to maintain up-to-date product information.

3. **🍎 Freshness Prediction of Produce**  
   Assesses the freshness of fruits and vegetables, classifying them as fresh, medium fresh, or rotten based on visual analysis.
